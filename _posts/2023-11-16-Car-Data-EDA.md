### Synopsis
In my exploratory data analysis (EDA), I delved into the details of car data, utilizing Python libraries to craft visualizations that unraveled diverse insights. From understanding price distributions and correlations between car features to exploring fuel efficiency trends and market popularity, the EDA journey illuminated compelling patterns, enriching my understanding of the multifaceted world of automobiles.



### Questions 

Before digging deeper into the analysis, I wanted to understand the data a bit more - specifically the distribution of prices from the data I have - I recognize that this may not contain everything or be completely up to date. 

#### The minimum car price is $2,000
#### The maximum car price is $2,065,902
#### The average car price is $40,594

From these numbers, these are the questions that I am curious about.

#### 1. Car Price Distribution: What is the distribution of car prices in the dataset?

#### 2. Price Variation Across Countries: How do car prices vary across different countries of origin?
#### 3. Correlation Between Engine Size and Horsepower: Is there a relationship between engine size and horsepower?
#### 4. Fuel Efficiency Analysis: How does city MPG and highway MPG vary across different car brands?
#### 5. Market Popularity Trends: Which car brands are the most popular based on their market category?

### EDA

In answering Question #1 - **What is the distribution of car pricds in the dataset**, I created a histogram comparing the prices and the frequency. It 



### Ethical Considerations

During web scraping, I prioritized ethical conduct by respecting website policies and terms of use. To prevent overloading servers, I implemented controlled scraping techniques, like rate limiting and request delays. I focused solely on gathering publicly available data relevant to the project's scope, ensuring no collection of sensitive or personal information. These measures ensured responsible and respectful data extraction while upholding website integrity.


## Conclusion 
You can see the actual result of my EDA in my next blog post (Cars)[]. Through the journey of compiling datasets, understanding pricing dynamics, and exploring the origins of car brands, this project has helped me build more connections within the automotive landscape. It has offered a deeper understanding of consumer behavior and industry dynamics.

The intertwined narratives discovered within the datasets not only shed light on the pricing disparities but also underscore the rich cultural and economic dimensions embedded within each car's origin. It has opened doors to further inquiries into market trends and consumer perceptions, laying the groundwork for future studies in automotive economics and consumer behavior.
